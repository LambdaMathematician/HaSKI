# HaSKI

### An FPGA-based SKI calculus evaluator written in C位ash/Haskell

HaSKI is my attempt at building a reasonably simple hardware-based evaluator
for the dead-simple, turing-complete [SKI combinator calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKI_combinator_calculus).

Because [I don't like most HDLs](http://yager.io/talks/CLaSH.pdf), I
decided to do this project using a Haskell-to-hardware compiler called
[C位ash](https://github.com/clash-lang/clash-compiler).

The SKI calculus is defined by three terms (`S`, `K`, and `I`), but these terms
don't have any side effects, so it's hard to make a pure SKI program
do anything interesting. Therefore, I added an `L` (for "Literal") term,
which is just like `I` except that it causes the evaluator to emit a 32-bit
value when evaluated.

For demonstration purposes, I use these 32-bit values to encode characters,
so that the evaluator can print things.


## The model evaluator

Because it's many times simpler, I've included a Haskell (not C位ash) SKI
calculus evaluator that isn't compilable to hardware. It's in `Model/`. To use
it, run

```
ghci Model/Programs.hs
evaluate hello4
evaluate $ parse "K(Ia)b"
```

## The hardware evaluator

The hardware evaluator does the same thing as the model evaluator, but
it can be implemented in hardware. This means that the only RAM
is that which is manually controlled over a data bus, which means we
have no stack, no heap, no garbage collection, etc. Therefore, we have to
be a lot more explicit about all the evaluator's possible states,
which means the code gets a lot more complicated.

### Simulation

Using the code in `Hardware/Sim/`, we can simulate the hardware by compiling
it to a binary. That's one of the great things about C位ash; it's all just
Haskell (plus some extensions), so we can compile it to a program just
like normal Haskell code.

To generate and run a binary,

```
clash Main.hs
./Main
```

Looking at the contents of `Main.hs`, you can see that it does the following:

* Compile the program "hello4" (which emits `hello_world!` four times)
* Compiles and formats the program into memory
* Prints the compiled program
* Runs the evaluator with the memory containing the compiled "hello4"
* Prints the character representation of all outputs

### Hardware

This is in progress! Ideally, this would be pretty much done,
but hardware is never as simple as you hope.
